## Configuring the Device

After [opening a k4a device](), we'll need to set up the cameras to grab color data! There's a lot of options here as well, so we'll go through them. Here's a quick example of what it looks like to start up a really basic color camera.

```C
// Configure a stream of 1280x720 BGRA color data at 5 frames per second
k4a_device_configuration_t config = K4A_DEVICE_CONFIG_INIT_DISABLE_ALL;
config.camera_fps       = K4A_FRAMES_PER_SECOND_5;
config.color_format     = K4A_IMAGE_FORMAT_COLOR_BGRA32;
config.color_resolution = K4A_COLOR_RESOLUTION_720P;

k4a_device_start_cameras(device, &config);
```

The `color_format` allows us to say how we want our color information stored in the image buffer! `K4A_IMAGE_FORMAT_COLOR_BGRA32` would be 32 bits per pixel, stored as 8 bits each for Blue, Green, Red, and Alpha. We use this format in the examples due to its convenience, but if you want to be concious of memory usage, other formats may be superior choices!

|`color_format`||
|--------------|-----------|
|`K4A_IMAGE_FORMAT_COLOR_MJPG`|Color data will be in [Motion JPEG format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_JPEG)|
|`K4A_IMAGE_FORMAT_COLOR_NV12`|[YUV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUV) color space 4:2:0 format, NV12, only available at 720p resolution.|
|`K4A_IMAGE_FORMAT_COLOR_YUY2`|[YUV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUV) color space 4:2:2 format, YUY2, only available at 720p resolution.|
|`K4A_IMAGE_FORMAT_COLOR_BGRA32`|Raw color data, 32 bits per pixel, ordered as Blue, Green, Red, Alpha|

While writing your own YUV conversion may be easy enough, a fast, robust library for YUV conversion can be found at [libyuv](https://chromium.googlesource.com/libyuv/libyuv/).

The `color_resolution` also has a couple of options!

|`color_resolution`|resolution|aspect|field of view| |
|------------------|----------|------|-------------|-|
|`K4A_COLOR_RESOLUTION_720P`  | 1280 x 720  | 16:9 | 90x59
|`K4A_COLOR_RESOLUTION_1080P` | 1920 x 1080 | 16:9 | 90x59
|`K4A_COLOR_RESOLUTION_1440P` | 2560 x 1440 | 16:9 | 90x59
|`K4A_COLOR_RESOLUTION_2160P` | 3840 x 2160 | 16:9 | 90x59
|`K4A_COLOR_RESOLUTION_1536P` | 2048 x 1536 | 4:3  | 90x74.3 
|`K4A_COLOR_RESOLUTION_3072P` | 4096 x 3072 | 4:3  | 90x74.3 | Max framerate 15.

And of course, the `camera_fps` as well.

|camera_fps||
|--|--|
|`K4A_FRAMES_PER_SECOND_5`
|`K4A_FRAMES_PER_SECOND_15`
|`K4A_FRAMES_PER_SECOND_30`

## Getting a Color Frame

Getting data for a color frame and a depth frame is a very similar process! First we get a capture from the device, then we extract the color image from it, and then we pull the raw data out of that image.

```C
// Wait until the first capture is available to us
k4a_capture_t capture;
k4a_device_get_capture(device, &capture, K4A_WAIT_INFINITE);

// Get the color data and information from the current capture
k4a_image_t colors      = k4a_capture_get_color_image(capture);
uint8_t    *colors_bgra = k4a_image_get_buffer(colors);
int width  = k4a_image_get_width_pixels (colors);
int height = k4a_image_get_height_pixels(colors);

// Write this capture to file
tga_write("out.tga", width, height, colorDataBGRA, 4, 3);
```

The data now stored in `colorDataBRGA` is dependant on the format we indicated in configuration. Since we asked for `K4A_IMAGE_FORMAT_COLOR_BGRA32`, we have an array full of 32 bit color values stored in BGRA order!

In this case, .tga files store colors in BGR order already! And since our saving function can skip the alpha channel with these arguments, we can just pass the image data as is!

## Cleaning Up

And as always, remember to release your resources when you're done with them!
```C
// Release all allocated resources, and shut down the Kinect
k4a_image_release(colors);
k4a_capture_release(capture);

k4a_device_stop_cameras(device);
k4a_device_close(device);
```
